So Mad Men is done. I'm glad. I didn't think the show was nearly as good as some other have claimed. I started
becoming increasingly bored around seasons 3/4. Now I don't have tho think about it.

But this really isn't about Mad Men, but rather time and entertainment. I watch very little of anything. What I
do watch (usually a couple hours per week, tops), has been a mix of movies and TV series. I've seen some really
excellent TV in the past few years (The Wire, The Shield, Breaking Bad, Sherlock). But I've also started the 
ROI of TV, even good shows.
