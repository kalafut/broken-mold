title: "Projects"

Since [DOS 2.11][] I've always been working on something. Side projects are fun and my way to try out a lot of technologies. Lately I seem to be writing a lot of **Go** and **Javascript**. My `~/dev` folder has hundreds of children. Sometimes the work exists elsewhere, such as some small contribution to a project on Github that I'll probably forget about. (And Github is surprisingly unhelpful at helping you track older contributions.) But I'd like to not forget about these endevors, hence this page.

## Active
**[kalafut.net][]**
: This site is of course a constant work-in-progress. It has evolved from a heavy Wordpress installation to a static site. Various blogging platforms, themes and hosting setups have been tried. Oh yeah, and there's the writing... :)

**[clerk][]**
: I've used a lot of personal finance tools over the years and they've all helped and annoyed me. Clerk is my attempt to do better.

**[finiki][]**
: A Wiki

## Completed

**[imohash][]**
: A constant-time hashing algorithm in **Go** and one of my better documented projects. This was surprisingly popular on Github.

**[vim-taskjuggler][]**
: Repackaged [TaskJuggler](http://www.taskjuggler.org/) syntax highlighting for easier installation by [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and the like.

**[WordyLinks][]**
: Sort of a bookmarking site, this was my first non-trivial **Go** program. It has been running for a couple of years with light usage (including by me at least once a week).

**fdoc**
: Android app for easily browsing [Fossil](http://fossil-scm.org) documentation, back when I was [evaluating that SCM tool]({{< relref "2015-01-29-fossil-1.md" >}}).

**<a href="/phonetics.png" data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Phonetics">Phonetics</a>**
: Simple phonetics app for Android. Type a letter then see and hear (in mine or my wife's voice!) the corresponding NATO phonetic.

**[Critigram][]**
: Display your [Criticker](http://criticker.com) ratings histogramically. Also, a test project for Coffeescript and Google Charts.

## Contributions
**[gb][]**
: Show vendor plugin help when no command is given.

**[glitch][]**
: Fixed issue where multiple builds occurred on OSX.

**[is][]**
: Added ability to redirect test output to a specified [io.Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer).

**[vimoutliner][]**
: Made help documentation UTF-8 compatible. This was pretty silly, actually. My original request was to just change "r√©gime" back to "regime" to make things work, but that was rejected...

**[carmen][]**
: Added functionality to exclude states/countries from this Ruby geography library.

**[autolink.vim][]**
: Replaced the defunct Blekko API with DuckDuckGo.

[**Two Scoops of Django**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981467342)
: Contributed to final review of the book.
