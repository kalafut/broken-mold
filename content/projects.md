Since [DOS 2.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) I've always been working on something. Side-projects are fun and my way to try out a lot of technologies. Lately I seem to be writing a lot of **Go** and **Javascript**. My `~/dev` folder has hundreds of children. Sometimes the work exists elsewhere, such as some small contribution to a project on Github that I'll probably forget about.(And Github is surprisingly unhelpful at helping you track older contributions.) But I'd like to not forget about these endevors, hence this page.

#### Active
[clerk](https://github.com/kalafut/clerk)
: I've used a lot of personal finance tools over the years and they've all helped and annoyed me. Clerk is my attempt to do better.

finiki  
: A Wiki

fff
: *Fast File Finder*. As ag is to grep, fff is to find. The goal is a file finder that just does the right thing. 

#### Planned
#### Complete

[**imohash**](https://github.com/kalafut/imohash)
: A constant-time hashing algorithm in **Go** and one of my better documented projects. This was surprisingly popular on Github.

[**vim-taskjuggler**](https://github.com/kalafut/vim-taskjuggler)
: Repackaged [TaskJuggler](http://www.taskjuggler.org/) syntax highlighting for easier installation by [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and the like.

[**WordyLinks**](http://wordylinks.kalafut.net)
: A small bookmarking site that was my first non-trivial **Go** program. It has been running for a couple of years with light usage (including by me at least once a week).

**fdoc**
: Android app for easily browsing [Fossil](http://fossil-scm.org) documentation, back when I was [evaluating that SCM tool]({{< relref "2015-01-29-fossil-1.md" >}}).

**Phonetics** (pic?)
**Table settings** (pic?)

## Contributions

[**glitch**](https://github.com/levicook/glitch/pull/3)
: Fixed multiple build issue on OSX.

[**vimoutliner**](https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Akalafut)
: Made help documentation UTF-8 compatible. This was pretty silly, actually. My original request was to just change "r√©gime" back to "regime" to make things work, but that was rejected...

[**backbone**](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/pull/2889)
: Doc fix.

[**is**](https://github.com/tylerb/is/issues/2)
: Added ability to redirect test output to a specified [io.Writer](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer).

[**carmen**](https://github.com/jim/carmen/commits?author=kalafut)
: Added functionality to exclude states/countries from this Ruby geography library.
